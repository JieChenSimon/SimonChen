## Welcome to Chen‘s HomePage.

USTS VRLAB, Master Student.

I am work on NLP, GNN, DL, ML, Data Mining, Interpretability. 
The ultimate goal of my research is to use mathematics to understand biological neural networks. My research have two stages: The first is to explore the relationship between the connection pattern of the deep learning model and biological neurons; The second is to use mathematics to explain the deep learning in order to make it interpretable. Besides, i am a reviewer of EMNLP2021, ICAIS2020.
