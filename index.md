## Research Interests
- NLP, GNN, DL, ML, Data Mining, Interpretability, Blockchain  
- My research aims to use **mathematics** to understand biological neural networks:
  - Stage 1: Explore the relationship between deep learning connection patterns and biological neurons.  
  - Stage 2: Use mathematics to explain deep learning for interpretability.  

Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for top conferences:  
**EMNLP 2021, EMNLP 2022, EACL 2023, ICAIS 2020.**
