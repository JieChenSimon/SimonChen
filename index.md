Southeast University Ph.D candidate.

Specialize in NLP, GNN, DL, ML, Data Mining, Interpretability, BlockChain. 
The ultimate goal of my research is to use mathematics to understand biological neural networks. My research have two stages: The first is to explore the relationship between the connection pattern of the deep learning model and biological neurons; The second is to use mathematics to explain the deep learning in order to make it interpretable. Besides, i am a reviewer of top conference: EMNLP2021, EMNLP2022, EACL2023, ICAIS2020.
